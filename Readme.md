=============

What is this?  A barebones Xcode 4 project for Mac OS X that creates an app which, when the user enables "Enable access for assistice devices" within the Universal Access panel of the Settings.app, will make their keyboard presses sound like an loud, old IBM keyboard.

In other words, it makes your keyboard sound old (turn up the volume on your Mac for maximum annoyance.)

Why did you write this?  A friend proposed it on Twitter, I had some free time and whipped it up.

What might it teach me?  Hmmm, it does show you how to play a sound file and how to install a key press interceptor by registering an event and attaching the event handler to a runloop.  I guess that's about it.

Enjoy annoying your coworkers with  ClackityClack.
